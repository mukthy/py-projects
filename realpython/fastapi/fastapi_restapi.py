# FASTAPI
# FastAPI is a Python framework for building blazing-fast APIs, it is written with creating REST Web APIs in mind.

# REST = REpresentational State Transfer
# Employs the HTTP protocol so it does not need a special platform to host the API.
# Uses the existing HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, it maps the CRUD functions create, read, update and delete to the HTTP methods.
# Access via an HTTP endpoint / web address.
# www.python.com/api/users
# Endpoints return an HTTP response with JSON.
# Reduces the noise associated with other REST Frameworks.
# SuperFast, Rivals for node.js and Go.
# Fewer Errors
# Less time to develop
# Uses open standards such as OpenAPI and JSON Schema.
# Employs Modern Python Features
# 1. Type Hinting
# 2. Async without requiring knowledge of asyncio in the standard library.
